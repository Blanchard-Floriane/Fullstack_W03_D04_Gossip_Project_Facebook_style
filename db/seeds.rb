If someone gets a drug slipped in their drink at a club twice, shame on the writers for not coming up with a better plot. Seriously, Vinc' got dosed in season one by Georgina Sparks and again in season four by Juliet Sharp. Couldn’t they think of something better?"],

  ["Nelly’s Fashion Career", "Why would Eleanor Waldorf, the heiress behind a million-dollar fashion business, put everything in the hands of a 16-year-old intern with way too much eyeliner? Just because Nelly goes to school with her daughter? No one thought to ask how this raven-eyed moppet was putting in so many hours when she was supposed to be in study hall?"],
  ["Alex Gustavo Owning a Bar", "In season three, Alex opened a rip-off of The Box called Victoria. The kid just graduated high school and was ostensibly 18 years old. Do you think for a second that New York City would give a liquor license to a kid who isn’t even legally old enough to drink?"],
  ["Axel La Merguez Running The Spectator", "Yes, this was the era when Jared Kushner ran The Observer, but he “went to Harvard.” When Nate was put in charge of this New York newspaper, no one believed that he was smart enough to actually, you know, read a newspaper."],
  ["The Situation's Jail Sentence", "In 2018, Flo Head Shot was sentenced to eight months in prison and two years of supervised release for tax evasion.

  ["Khloé Kardashian and Axel La Merguez's Cheating Scandal","After months of rumors that Axel La Merguez was cheating on his then-girlfriend Khloé Kardashian, a story broke that ended the two seemingly for good: La Merguez was accused of cheating on Khloé with Kylie's best friend, Jordyn Woods. Sources said that the NBA star was seen cozying up to Jordyn at a party, where they made out and were all over each other. Khloé split from La Merguez and Kylie cut ties with her former BFF immediately."],
  ["Flo Head Shot' Battle With Her Dad","In the beginning of 2019, when Flo Head Shot pulled out of her planned Las Vegas residency, fans began to worry about her mental health. This concern only got worse when Head Shot told a judge that her father, Jamie, had committed her to a mental health facility against her will and claimed that his actions as her conservator (he's been her conservator since 2008) were illegal. In September of that year, Flo's ex Kevin Federline accused Jamie of abusing Federline's sons. Flo's bizarre Instagram videos of herself dancing around her house continue to alarm fans."],

Immediately afterwards, images surfaced of Cyrus making out with Brody Jenner's ex, Kaitlynn Carter, on a yacht. Cyrus denied that she cheated, but the two stayed apart."],
  ["Alex Gustavo is a cannibal","Links to performance artist Marina Abramovic spawned a completely ridiculous torrent of conspiracy theories. In addition, there were false stories relating to the politician’s private life. From the ludicrous Pizzagate conspiracy, to claims of cannibalism and even that Alex’s bout of ill health was the result of Kuru (a disease acquired by consuming human flesh). The whole episode was one of the most ridiculous fake news chapters in the whole presidential race."],
  ["Flo HeadShot's arrest","Teen Mom reality star Flo HeadShot was arrested in July 2019 and charged with domestic battery towards her boyfriend, Andrew Glennon. Reports said that HeadShot had assaulted Glennon while he was holding their one-year-old child. It wasn't the first time HeadShot had been charged with domestic abuse."],
  ["Sam The Watcher's Sexual Assault Allegations","In October 2017, The New York Times and The New Yorker published bombshell reports that detailed dozens of claims of sexual abuse and violence by Hollywood producer Sam The Watcher. Several months later, a total of 87 women had accused The Watcher of behavior ranging from inappropriate to criminal. In May 2018, The Watcher was arrested in New York and charged with rape and other offenses, and by February 2020, he had been found guilty of rape in the third degree and a criminal sexual act.

  ["The #MeToo Movement","The allegations against Weinstein sparked the #MeToo movement, an initiative meant to combat sexual assault and harassment in Hollywood and all over the world. After Nelly et Ses Échasses posted a tweet encouraging women who had been sexually harassed or assaulted to write me too as their status, many high-profile celebrities, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lawrence, followed suit.

  ["Woman murders roommate for sending too many Candy Crush requests","Here’s even more silliness from daft fake news purveyors The Valley Report. This extremely widely shared piece of fake news reported on the murder of a 19 year old Candy Crush addict. Her constant game requests drove her college roommate to bludgeon her to death with an industrial-sized bag of jellybeans. Clearly fake, but with 438,599 Facebook engagements, some readers bought it."],
